    "Hey, I'm Edmond! I'm a Front-End Web Developer currently in New York City. During the Winter of 2018, I stumbled upon various resources online to learn web development and programming such as FreeCodeCamp, CS50, and ZeroToMastery. As soon as I began, I was captivated by the infinite and creative capabilities of web development & programming. On that day, I've promised myself to travel along the life-long journey of a self-taught developer and become a permanent student of the craft striving to improve consistently, getting 1% better each and every day.",
  paragraphTwo:
    'I design and build UI components to enhance website application performance and user experience using modern technologies like React, JavaScript, and SCSS. Also have been dabbling with Gatsby.js and Next.js for static sites, and Python for scripting/automation & web-scraping.',
